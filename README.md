# LocalJournal

Local Journal is a simple secure journaling app.
To give the user full control over their data, entries are stored as plain text files on the users device.

Local Journal was built because I did not trust my data with the common journaling apps. It also provides a good way for me to work on Xamarin / MVVM development skills.

## Current features

* Cross platform, Windows & Android.
* Encryption for individual entries.
* Easily edit unencrypted entries in your own text editor.

## Download

The app is currently in a usable state, but not ready for general use. As a result you will have to download and compile the source.

## Future

This app is being built for my personal use, as time permits.

You are free to add issues, or comment on existing issues to give them priority.
